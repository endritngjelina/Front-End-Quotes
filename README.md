# Front-End Quotes – Multi-Version Web Project

This is a front-end project featuring **multiple versions** of quote display pages.  
Each version uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to present quotes in different ways, with variations in layout, styling, and interactivity.

### 🔧 What’s Inside

- Clean HTML structure
- Custom CSS for layout, spacing, and typography
- JavaScript to add dynamic behavior (e.g. cycling quotes, animations, etc.)
- Multiple quote versions to explore different styles

### 📁 File Overview

- `quote 1.html` – Version 1 of the quote layout  
- `quote 2.html` – Version 2 with a different design  
- (More versions may be added)  
- Supporting CSS and JS files may be embedded or linked per version

### 🎯 Why I Built This

I’m using this project to:

- Practice combining HTML, CSS, and JS on small, focused UI features
- Explore creative front-end styling techniques
- Build clean, reusable layouts for displaying content like quotes

### 💡 Future Ideas

- Add a version with random quote generation  
- Animate quotes in/out with JS  
- Create a single-page version that cycles through all styles
